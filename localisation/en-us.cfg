		#WGR_Desc_MHR_probecore = By teaching ants how to operate simple switches and follow instructions under high-stress environments, this light-weight probe core is ideal for very few things.
		#WGR_Desc_MHR_nose = This sleek nose cone will help reduce your aerodynamic footprint! It also comes with a built-in light-weight data transmitter to make up for it.
		#WGR_Desc_MHR_booster = The fuel rate of this oddly-shaped booster is only limited by the amount of G's it can generate before imploding.
		#WGR_Desc_MHR_fin = After an investigation on the odd ambient chirping noise commonly heard outside the Space Center led to the discovery of an animal native to the air, efforts were made to adopt their features to our rockets.
